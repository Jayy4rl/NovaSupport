# NovaSupport Contract ABI

Reference implementation: `contract/contracts/support_page/src/lib.rs`

## Contract ID

Deploy the contract to Stellar Testnet, then set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` in `frontend/.env.local` to the deployed contract ID.

This repository does not currently include a checked-in deployed contract ID.

## Functions

### `initialize(env, admin) -> Result<(), Error>`

Initializes the contract, setting the admin and pausing state. Can only be called once.

Parameters:

- `env: Env` - Soroban execution environment.
- `admin: Address` - Address that becomes the contract administrator. Must authorize the call via `require_auth()`.

Returns:

- `Result<(), Error>` - `Ok(())` on success.

Behavior:

- Rejects calls if the contract has already been initialized (`AlreadyInitialized`).
- Stores the `Admin` address in persistent storage.
- Sets the `Paused` flag to `false`.
- Extends TTL for both storage entries.

Errors:

- `AlreadyInitialized` (202) - Contract has already been initialized.
- Soroban auth failure - If `admin` does not authorize the call.

### `pause(env) -> Result<(), Error>`

Pauses the contract, preventing `support()` and `withdraw()` calls. Requires admin authorization.

Parameters:

- `env: Env` - Soroban execution environment.

Returns:

- `Result<(), Error>` - `Ok(())` on success.

Behavior:

- Loads `Admin` from persistent storage; fails with `ContractNotInitialized` if absent.
- Requires authorization from the admin address.
- Sets the `Paused` flag to `true`.
- Emits a `pause` event with the admin address and current timestamp.

Errors:

- `ContractNotInitialized` (201) - Contract has not been initialized.
- Soroban auth failure - If admin does not authorize the call.

### `unpause(env) -> Result<(), Error>`

Unpauses the contract, re-enabling `support()` and `withdraw()` calls. Requires admin authorization.

Parameters:

- `env: Env` - Soroban execution environment.

Returns:

- `Result<(), Error>` - `Ok(())` on success.

Behavior:

- Loads `Admin` from persistent storage; fails with `ContractNotInitialized` if absent.
- Requires authorization from the admin address.
- Sets the `Paused` flag to `false`.
- Emits an `unpause` event with the admin address and current timestamp.

Errors:

- `ContractNotInitialized` (201) - Contract has not been initialized.
- Soroban auth failure - If admin does not authorize the call.

### `support(env, supporter, recipient, asset, amount, asset_code, message) -> Result<u32, Error>`

Records a support action, transfers tokens from supporter to contract, updates per-recipient and per-asset accounting, and returns the updated global count.

Parameters:

- `env: Env` - Soroban execution environment.
- `supporter: Address` - Address that must authorize the call via `require_auth()`.
- `recipient: Address` - Address receiving support.
- `asset: Address` - Soroban token contract address to transfer.
- `amount: i128` - Amount to transfer. Must be positive.
- `asset_code: String` - Asset code label such as `"XLM"` or `"USDC"` (1-12 characters).
- `message: String` - Support message (1-280 characters).

Returns:

- `Result<u32, Error>` - The updated global support count after this call.

Behavior:

- Rejects calls if the contract is not initialized or is paused.
- Rejects calls where `amount <= 0`.
- Rejects calls with empty or oversized messages (max 280 characters).
- Rejects calls with empty or oversized asset codes (max 12 characters).
- Checks supporter token balance; rejects if insufficient.
- Transfers `amount` tokens from `supporter` to the contract via the Soroban token client.
- Increments the global `SupportCount`.
- Increments `RecipientCount` for this recipient.
- Adds `amount` to `RecipientTotal` for this recipient and asset pair.
- Emits a `support` event with the full payload including a timestamp.
- Returns the new global support count.

Errors:

- `ZeroAmount` (2) - `amount` is zero.
- `NegativeAmount` (3) - `amount` is negative.
- `EmptyMessage` (4) - `message` is empty.
- `MessageTooLong` (5) - `message` exceeds 280 characters.
- `InvalidAssetCode` (6) - `asset_code` is empty or exceeds 12 characters.
- `InsufficientBalance` (300) - Supporter does not have enough tokens.
- `ContractNotInitialized` (201) - Contract has not been initialized.
- `ContractPaused` (200) - Contract is paused.
- Soroban auth failure - If `supporter` does not authorize the call.

### `withdraw(env, caller, recipient, asset, amount) -> Result<(), Error>`

Allows a recipient to withdraw their supported funds from the contract.

Parameters:

- `env: Env` - Soroban execution environment.
- `caller: Address` - Address initiating the withdrawal. Must be the same as `recipient`. Must authorize via `require_auth()`.
- `recipient: Address` - Address receiving the withdrawn funds.
- `asset: Address` - Soroban token contract address to withdraw.
- `amount: i128` - Amount to withdraw. Must be positive and not exceed the recipient's balance.

Returns:

- `Result<(), Error>` - `Ok(())` on success.

Behavior:

- Rejects calls if the contract is not initialized or is paused.
- Rejects calls where `caller != recipient` (`NotRecipient`).
- Rejects calls where `amount <= 0`.
- Rejects calls if the recipient has never received support (`RecipientNotFound`).
- Rejects calls if the recipient's recorded balance is zero (`ZeroBalance`).
- Rejects calls if `amount` exceeds the recipient's recorded balance for this asset.
- Checks the contract's actual token balance; rejects if insufficient (`InsufficientContractBalance`).
- Transfers `amount` tokens from the contract to `recipient`.
- Deducts `amount` from `RecipientTotal` for this recipient and asset pair.
- Emits a `withdraw` event with the caller, asset, and amount.

Errors:

- `ZeroAmount` (2) - `amount` is zero.
- `NegativeAmount` (3) - `amount` is negative.
- `NotRecipient` (102) - `caller` is not the same as `recipient`.
- `ContractNotInitialized` (201) - Contract has not been initialized.
- `ContractPaused` (200) - Contract is paused.
- `RecipientNotFound` (402) - Recipient has never received support.
- `ZeroBalance` (403) - Recipient's recorded balance is zero.
- `WithdrawAmountExceedsBalance` (303) - Requested amount exceeds recipient's recorded balance.
- `InsufficientContractBalance` (301) - Contract does not hold enough tokens.
- Soroban auth failure - If `caller` does not authorize the call.

### `support_count(env) -> u32`

Returns the total number of successful `support()` calls recorded by the contract.

Parameters:

- `env: Env` - Soroban execution environment.

Returns:

- `u32` - Current global support count. Returns `0` when no support has been recorded.

### `recipient_count(env, recipient) -> u32`

Returns the number of support actions received by a specific recipient.

Parameters:

- `env: Env` - Soroban execution environment.
- `recipient: Address` - Address to query.

Returns:

- `u32` - Number of support actions for this recipient. Returns `0` if the recipient has never received support.

### `get_recipient_total(env, recipient, asset) -> i128`

Returns the total amount of a specific asset received by a specific recipient (including withdrawals deducted). Mirrors `get_total_by_asset` and reads from the same `RecipientTotal(Address, Address)` storage key (keyed by recipient and asset, returning a per-asset total rather than an aggregate across assets).

Parameters:

- `env: Env` - Soroban execution environment.
- `recipient: Address` - Address to query.
- `asset: Address` - Soroban token contract address to query.

Returns:

- `i128` - Total amount of this asset received by this recipient. Returns `0` if unknown.

Returns the total amount of a specific asset received by a specific recipient (including withdrawals deducted).

Parameters:

- `env: Env` - Soroban execution environment.
- `recipient: Address` - Address to query.
- `asset: Address` - Soroban token contract address to query.

Returns:

- `i128` - Total amount of this asset received by this recipient. Returns `0` if unknown.
